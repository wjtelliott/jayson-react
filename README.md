# YouBetcha

## This is a monolithic approach to the PERN stack app YouBetcha

### Scripts:

-   "build" -> Generate a build version and install server modules
-   "winbuild" -> Windows syntax of the build script
-   "start" -> Start the server of the build version
-   "server" -> Start the server only for testing\*
-   "client" -> Start the client only for testing
-   "dev" -> Runs both npm run client and npm run server

\*Server only serves the build folder of react client
